### Coursera - Data Science - Capstone Project

## textPredCoursera

**The "textPredCoursera" is a simple Shiny app created for the [Capstone Project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-project) of the [Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) Coursera course.**

The app contains a predictive text model that may guess the most likely word following a given text message and, in addition, also provide several alternatives for what the next word might be. For example, when we type: "It was nice", the next word might be most likely to be "to"; or it might be something like "meeting", "seeing", ... In this app, the predictions are based on machine learning from written text data sourced from Internet blogs, news and twitter. The data set is available here: [Coursera-SwiftKey.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip).
